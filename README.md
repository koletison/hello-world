Kole here. I don't know much about this platform, but I understand the relevance so I would like to begin learning what it is all about. I enjoy the concept of tools and their applications across scholarly disciplines. Biology is my fascination, and I'd like to learn a few coding tools to facilitate this pursuit of knowledge. Perhaps this is somewhere to begin.
